## Embed Retool withÂ NextJS

In this tutorial we are going to build a component that we can use in our full stack application NextJS.

If you're unfamiliar with Retool, it's a robust solution for building applications that require minimal coding. While a basic understanding of JavaScript and SQL is helpful, you don't need to be an expert in these languages.

Intrigued by its capabilities, I decided to give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly and easily you can achieve impressive results using Retool.

In the realm of business software, certain fundamental components form its foundation: Tables, Lists, Charts, Forms, Wizards, Maps, and more. With Retool, these essential building blocks come readily available, saving you the effort of creating them from scratch.
